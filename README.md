# PythonANNFromScratch
An artificial neural network (ANN) created in Python from scratch

This ANN has an input layer, 2 hidden layers, and an output layer

The layers are all modular - meaning that the number of nodes in each layer can be changed

The ANN can approximate any function given enough training data and time

The ANN can also save its data
