# PythonANNFromScratch
An artificial neural network (ANN) created in Python from scratch

This ANN has an input layer, 2 hidden layers, and an output layer

The layers are all modular - meaning that the number of nodes in each layer can be changed

The ANN can approximate any function given enough training data and time

The ANN can also save and read its data

This branch of the ANN will be specified to work on the handwritten digits problem

Since the handwritten digits problem has binary inputs and outputs, this branch of the ANN will retain the sigmoid activation function

IMPORTANT: In order to train/test the ANN, files named mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv were downloaded and included in the PythonANNFromScratch directory. Since those files were relatively large, they have not been included in the repository. The files can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?select=mnist_test.csv
